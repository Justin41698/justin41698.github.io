  <div class="bodytext"><h1 class="header" id="aboutme">About Me</h1>
  <p class="body">I currently reside in Des Moines, Iowa, where I attend Grand View University.  I am chasing a degree in Elementary Education while 
    specializing in Special Education.  I also will be getting my minor in Psychology.  I also spent two years at South Dakota State University.
    My current hometown is Clarion, Iowa, but I also like to claim Toledo, Ohio as another home of mine, as that is where I was raised until about 15-years-old.</p>
  <h2 class="header" id="whatido">What I Do</h2>
  <p class="body">If you are reading this you must have found this page because of wrestling.  I am currently working every day to earn a National Championship.  I took 3rd place
    at Nationals last year, and my team won their 7th straight Natty Title!  One of my biggest passions is coaching.  I offer clinics, one-on-ones, week long camps, and more.
    I want to help create amazing wrestlers.</p>
  <h3 class="header" id="whyidoit">Why I Do It</h3>
  <p class="body">When I was young, I had many great coaches.  They all impacted me and changed me in tremendous ways.  I would not be the person I am today if it was not for them.  I want to
    be able to impact kids that same way.  I also want to help keep them out of trouble and off the streets by doing something productive with their lives!  Lastly, I am doing this to spread my love for a sport that has done so much for me! Wrestling is the oldest and greatest sport in the universe, and I want other people to enjoy it as I have!</p> </div>
